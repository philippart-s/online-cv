career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After many years spent in the world of development, expertise and software architecture I chose to change path. 
      Indeed, the relationship with developers being a very important element for me I decided to become Developer Relation. 
      
      Sharing is an essential element for me: that's why I co-created an association whose goal is to organize meetups around agility and DevOps: TADx. 
      
      Always with the aim of sharing:
        - I am a speaker at conferences (all my conferences are available here: https://noti.st/philippart-s).
        - I am a monthly podcast host (Tranches de Tech : https://podcast.ausha.co/tranches-de-tech).-
        - I host Twitch (https://bit.ly/twitch-replays)
        - I write articles for the magazine Programmez.
        - I write technical blog posts on my personal blog (https://philippart-s.github.io/blog/)

      Within my different teams I have often assumed the role of team lead (or tech lead) in order to organize the team as well as to define the team's strategy.
